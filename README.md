### Project Solution:
_Include a comprehensive summary of all important information about your project solution here._
All necessary code files and any additional information required to judge your project solution should be included in the repository. 

We have completed all five tasks and are pleased to present our solution. We suggest the following order for reviewing the materials:

* **Start by watching the 3-minute video**: This video provides an overview of our solution and can serve as a good introduction to further analysis.

* **Read the report**: The report contains detailed explanations of our approach and methodology, helping to better understand our work.

* **Review the code**: Finally, we encourage you to go through the Jupyter notebooks and Python files, which contain the implementations for each task.

All materials, including the slides and the report, are available in our GitHub repository as well as in the shared Google Drive folder
